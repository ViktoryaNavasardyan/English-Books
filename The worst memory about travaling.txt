When I first traveled, we flew to Egypt. First we went to Georgia, and from there we just flew to Egypt, because there was not a single flight to Egypt from Armenia, and before that I comunicate to a classmate who had chickenpox, and he did not tell me that he was sick, otherwise I wouldn't invite him to my birthday, but well, I didn't know and called, and we talked and I probably got infected like this, so we decided not to pay attention and flew away. There, after one or two days, I realized that I was already sick with chickenpox because the first signs appeared. after a few days I was already ill completely because all over my body pour out the rash and the temperature was very high. Well, I remember that then I almost never left the room, but we went to see several places then I also went with my parents and I remember that at the airport we were very afraid that they would notice me and I wrapped myself in scarves, put on jeans, long sleeves in this hot summer. But thank God Nobody noticed anything and we flew normally. But it was terrible. I felt bad I could not stand on my feet and as if I was fainting due to the fact that I was very weak. this was the worst trip in my life
